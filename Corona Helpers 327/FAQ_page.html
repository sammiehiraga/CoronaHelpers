            <li1>2. Does it cost money?</li1>

            <li1>3. How can I make sure i find people near me?</li1>
            <li2>This service is for the City of San Francisco. We recommend that you include your neighborhood in your post, or neighborhoods you would be willing to go to if you are a helper. This helps people seeking help find people close by. </li2>
            <li1>4. Who can use the service?</li1>
            <li2>Anyone can use the service. This site doesn't have anything to do with actually recruiting people, it is simply a place where people can connect. </li2>

            <li2>A group of San Francisco State Students who were looking for a way to help during the Coronavirus pandemic. </li2>
